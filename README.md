# Develop-Simple-Chatbots-using-Python-and-Deep-Learning
Overview
A Chatbot is an application designed for managing online chat conversations through text or text-to-speech formats. This project focuses on building a chatbot using a Sequential Neural Network (SNN) with natural language processing capabilities.

Components
train_chatbot.py: This script reads natural language text/data to create a training set. It implements a Sequential Neural Network using Keras for model creation.

chat_gui.py: This code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for the chatbot, enhancing user interaction.

classes.pkl: Contains a list of various response classes for the chatbot.

word.pkl: Consists of a list of words used for pattern recognition in the chatbot.

intent.json: A list of JavaScript objects defining different tags with respect to word patterns for identifying user intents.

chatbot_model.h5: The trained model created in train_chatbot.py and chat_gui.py, saved in the HDF5 format.

NLTK Setup
To enable natural language processing, NLTK setup involves:

nltk.download('punkt'): Downloads Punkt tokenizer models for sentence tokenization.
nltk.download('wordnet'): Downloads WordNet lexical database for word lemmatization.
Lemmatization
Lemmatization is implemented using the WordNetLemmatizer class from NLTK, reducing words to their base or root form.

Preprocess Data
Text data preprocessing involves tokenization, breaking down text into individual words or tokens. The nltk.word_tokenize() method is utilized for this purpose. Additionally, the project includes processes for lemmatization and creating lists of classes for tags.
